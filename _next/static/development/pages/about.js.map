I grew up side by side with her in my mother’s garden of vegetables and flowers. The bubble bees were my playmates and dandelions in demand for wine.  My father coming home to tell me the Linden flowers (Basswood flowers) were ready to pick. We would use them to make a tea for sore throats. Days of sunny skies and creating creatures out of cloud formations warms my heart on a cold -28 below zero morning and a smile to my face. I have always kept my nose to the ground picking agates and mushrooms since I can remember; the ground holds treasures to delight in and heal us. My mother’s Doctor couldn’t say it any better \"It must be all that good healthy living.\" He only seen her once a year for her yearly checkup. Her life was: pray, garden, good food, and kindness. Kindness goes a long way in making one feel good.</p>\n        <p>As I grew older I started to get eczema on my arms how they inched. It didn’t take much for them to bleed. Nothing I could find on the store shelves never helped. I never had enough money to spend a lot, so I began to add GOOD oils to the lotions I bought, and it helped some. Then I thought if it helps if I add what if I made my own. In 2006 Butterfly Butters and Oils was created. It began with pour and melt soaps and whipped shea butter. I failed quiet often because believe me when I say, \"Don’t believe everything you read on the computer.\" But what I did learn that with using good shea butter and coconut oils I no longer had any problems with eczema.</p>\n        <p>It became an addiction. It wasn’t long before I gave up the whipped shea butters and began making my lotions and creams. I gave up lotions for the fabulous results from my creams. With the help of aromatherapy books, I created one of the best insect repellents around. I love working with essential oils and now not working with them. My hand-crafted soaps are made with herbs and spices for color and benefits. Try it and you will like it!!</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n)\n","module.exports = dll_b2d9fd95b535cd8bf589;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;AAAA;;;;;;;;;;;ACAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ACvBA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AARA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ACAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
